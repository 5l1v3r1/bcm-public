It's main intension was to enable monitor mode and frame injection, which is already working quite well. Nevertheless, we also publish many example patches that allow to dive into firmware reverse engineering and firmware patching. Especially, the ability to write firmware patches in C makes it easy to use, also for beginners.\r\n\r\nIf you only intend to activate monitor mode on a device using the bcmdhd driver, take a look at the following commit: [ed11c18](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/bcm-public/commit/ed11c18aa89cd0374a3ce7655337cc0e4d1cdd0a)\r\n\r\n## News\r\n\r\n* We moved to **[GitHub!](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/bcm-public)**\r\n* You can now follow us on twitter: [@nexmon_dev](https://twitter.com/nexmon_dev)\r\n\r\n## Related Projects\r\n* Monitor Mode for the Raspberry Pi 3: [rpi3.nexmon.org](http://rpi3.nexmon.org)\r\n\r\n## WARNING\r\n\r\nOur software may damage your hardware and may void your hardwareâ€™s warranty!

This makes it impossible to receive frames in an 802.11n/802.11ac enabled environment.~~\r\n * Current Monitor Mode was tested and works for 802.11n with 20MHz wide channels (2.4 as well as 5GHz), ~~40MHz channels seems to be a problem. We keep working on it ;-)~~\r\n * Using this [patch](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/bcm-public/blob/90bed6e1c3ad70ddc23ccf44033b152e0db300b6/kernel_patches/40mhz_channels_5GHz.patch) should enalbe `iw` to set 40MHz channels. It currently only works for 5GHz frequencies. \r\n   Capturing WiFi packets which use mutliple spatial streams is still not possible, this is caused by a hardware limitation of the Nexus 5\r\n\r\n## Read our papers\r\n\r\nFeel free to read and reference our papers on the development of this project \r\n\r\n* M.
