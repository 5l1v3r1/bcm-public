The intention of this patch is to find all pathes to the dma_txfast function. 
Hence, we like to transmit a stack trace to the Linux driver, whenever 
dma_txfast gets call. To transmit the stack trace, we would like to use 
the dngl_sendpkt function, which also calls the dma_txfast function. To avoid
loops, we copy the whole path from dngl_sendpkt to dma_txfast to 0x180050.
